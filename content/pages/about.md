# Our Status : Product Development

Ellelly Ltd is an innovative new registerd company passionate about the need for new vision and energy ready to fulfil the need at a time when our world community is ready to act.

# Our Partners

Ellelly is working hand in hand with sustainability experts, the best fair trade suppliers, local communities, local authorities and major retail sellers to deliver our premium sustainable products to make them as affordable and accessible to the general population.



# Our Values

Ellelly believes in the potential of humanity to live in balance with nature and our environment. We as a species are evolving to understand that we are not just creatures living on the planet. We are part of the planet. To take care of our world is to take care of ourselves. Our products are of the highest standard because we only produce for others what we would want for ourselves. Quality, sustainability, comfort and empathy are at the heart of everything we do.



# Our Competitors

Based on our  research there is no product currently on the market that achieves all of the features we have set about to bring to the market.

While there are similar products that are in the same price range, they do not offer the comprehensive features and sustainability elements that our product will introduce.

Likewise, while there are similar products that do offer the same comprehensive features, they are priced too high for the general market and we believe donâ€™t go far enough with their sustainability features, such as sourcing fabrics with 0% elasticine.
